#Belen's Portfolio
Hello! My name is Belen Saldana, it's my first semester at Cal State Fullerton, and I'm majoring in computer science.  This is my introduction to coding, and I'm learning a lot.  
## Lab Reflections

### Lab 1
* Although this lab was really simple and short, it was exactly what was needed as someone who was coding for the first time.  I’ve heard the “Hello World!” project is classic, and completing it made me feel included.  I learnt the basics of how to use a terminal and how to open a file; all without the pressure of something difficult due.
### Lab 6
* This lab had both blackjack and sandwich, both of which I found fun. Blackjack was my favorite, and I think it was a good midpoint for knowing how to use bools.  I learnt of two different ways to convert the card name into an integer, including stoi (string to integer).
### Lab 11
* hilo was the more difficult between the two parts, but I like this lab because it’s were I’ve had a little more understanding.  I liked the linting and formatting from both parts of the lab.  I learnt about private and public, and with guidance was able to finish.
